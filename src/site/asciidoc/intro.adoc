= Project introduction

This project aims to the fast and compact implementation of the actor processing model.

== Fundamentals
Originally, the actor model was laid out by Carl Hewitt in his reseach paper <<ACTOR>> in 1977.
Some refinements were given by Carl Hewitt in his research paper <<ROBUST>> in 2017.

An actor is a computational entity for processing messages. In response to a received message, it can take the
following actions:

* send a finite number of messages to other actors
* spwan a finite number of new actors
* define the behavior for the next message it receives

There is no restriction on the order or parallelism on the actions taken in response to a message.

== Module overview
The project consists of a couple of modules:

* _build-tools_: Bundles all er-project configurations for *checkstyle*, *PMD*, and *spobugs*
* _openactors4j-core_: Core aspects of the implementation

== Topics overview

* For a general overview of messaging styles and message processing, see <<message-processing.adoc#,Messaging>>
* The adressing scheme for actors is explained here <<adressing.adoc#,Actor adressing>>
* For information about actor relationship and supervision, see <<hierarchy.adoc#,Hierachy>>
* The lifecycle of an actor is described here <<lifecycle.adoc#,Lifecycle>>
