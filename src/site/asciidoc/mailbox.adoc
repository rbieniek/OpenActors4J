= Mailbox

The concept of mailboxes is a central piece of the overall message delivery system. Each actor instance has its own
mailbox to which messages, targetted onto the actor, are delivered into.

The actor is never called directly in the message delivery process. Any inbound message is placed into the the actor's
mailbox and taken for processing whenever the actor system scheduler decides to process the next message in that
mailbox
